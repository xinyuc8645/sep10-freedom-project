# SEP10 Freedom Project
by Xin Yu Chen

## Context
I am a student at [HSTAT](https://www.hstat.org/) in the [Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/). The "Freedom Project" for SEP10 is a year-long project all about making a website that informs the viewer of the current and future innovations in the topic of my choosing.

For my project, I chose the topic of Animations 

I used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Github. I also chose to independently study the Aframe tool in order to help me make my website.
# Blog Overview
Throughout, the blogs listed below the blog section, it all contains informations that basically sums up the information and the timeline in which the freedom project start and ends. And some additional informations about the SEP10 Freedom Project
## What exactly is an freedom project, especially for SEP10? 
The SEP10 freedom project, is an project where the student, chooses an topic they would like to study on, and by researching topics related to it. More specifically, like softwares/hardwares, additionally later on they get the opportunity to make an future invention that is also related to their topic. By researching these informations that relates to their topic, later they are required to design and create an website that teaches the outside audience about their topic and educate them. This can made be possible by their knowledge they have to them learning HTML, CSS, bootstraps codes. They are also required to use and learn an outside "tool", like Aframe, Bulma and etc to further more support their topic and what they have created. In the end, once again they should have made an fully layed out website about their topics, both including hardwares, softwares, their tool, an well designed laid, bootstrap component and showcasing them during the expo. Before the expo occurs, they are also required to present to their class by creating an slide show that shows how they created their website, what challenges they face and how they use their tools. That's basically the gist of the SEP10 Freedom Project.

## Implications My Topic Animations Has On Society
##### PROS
###### Global
* For the environment, animations has several pros to offer, for such if during the production, animators instead of using many energy and wasting them. They can reduce the energy needed for the hardwares and softwares, resulting in renewable energy sources, which then results in less impact on the environments.
* Another pros for the environment is that by it can provide, environmental awareness education to outsides audience. By doing this, people can better understand the environment better and how they can treat it with more care.
* Animations can also provide better visuals and eye catching for people, who don't want to read/look at heavy documents
* By using animations, it can also overcome language barriers, difference in culture and etc, resulting in more diversity overall and an better impact both for the populations and the society involved.
###### Economics
* Animations provides, those who have artistic skills to freely express themselves, resulting in once again lot's more diversity and difference
* Animations also involves teamwork, which can bring people together and overall result in more friendly relationship and communication between the two parties.
###### Social
* Often with the use of animations, which turns into animated stories like anime, it often bonds people together, through the relatable challenges, the character face and by the fact that the audience can feel what they are going through.
* Animations stories, also often help young children understand the concept of cause and effect through the story.
##### CONS
###### Global
* While using the tools of animations, they can be often use to simplify complicated and complexed ideas, there is a possibility that the simplified ideas, can result in bias ideas, misinformations and misinterpretations. Which then can led to government, public and societies being misunderstood.
* Before modern age of animations arrived, the ages during the 18th's, 19th's and the 20th's centuries, all have politically cartoon that is animated, but not moving. However these cartoon that is animated even though they are not moving they serve as an propaganda which can mislead people and directly manipulate them.
###### Social
* As people can know, animations can be associated with many things, however in this case many thinks of anime. Sometimes with anime it can lead those who are in an relationship to have an unrealistic goal or expectation, due to many romance anime, sets an unrealistic goal for real couples or those who are in relationships.
* Animations; animes, can also leads to stereotypes especially depending on the people's gender and what their role is in that society for that anime.
###### Economics
* Rendering an hyper realistic and creating an realistic infrastructure, through the use of animation often requires lots of RAM and energy, meaning it will take lots of time for it to completely render it
* Animations, especially animating, for those who has jobs related to it, often has to work overtime, and long hours, due to short deadlines and the expectations the studio has for them.
