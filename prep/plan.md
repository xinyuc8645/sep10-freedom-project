#### MVP/Timeline
* Navbar required, max effort,  MVP atleast, put an Navbar, make it fixed top, change the button on top to the correct section for each part and make sure it works.
* Beneath that, add the introduction for my FP project, afterward copy and paste the introduction paragraph.
* Then make a container, within that container needs to fit my Content Part A, and will have 3 smaller paragraphs.
* Underneath that 3 paragraphs will be provided with 2 evenly spreaded out image.
* Make another container for Part B, and this time splitting the paragraphs into 4 sections.
* Underneath that 4 paragraphs section, there will be a big image carousel of images that is accessible that is viable.
* Underneath that section, there is accordion with 4 section also but will be 2x2; 2 on top 2 on bottom
* Image within those accordion when you open them up
* Rename those accordion, put the information in the accordion
* Lastly, underneath will be the about us/FAQ
