<h1>My purpose and motivation for choosing this specfic topic.</h1>
<p> Before I answer my purpose of why I decided to choose this topic and my motivates for it, you may be asking me like "You know there are tons of other options for you to choose from right? Ranging from arts, businesses, sports and so much more. Well it's just that those other option doesn't really interest me specfically Alright, now that I'm ready, so why did I choose the topic of animation in the first place? Well it had all to circulate back to like a few years ago, I became really intereste in animated shorts, and films, specfically as you may known it to today, as anime, which is very popular in Japan and outside of Japan. The way the studios would animate an character smoothly, and the way they depcit the plot of the story, really pulls me in into animating. For example, anime's like Demon Slayer and Fate series, are very popular due to their animations being top quality and putted into efforts. Thus why it pulls me in as an blackhole. While I was researching, I come across interesting articles that relates to animations/animating like, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/understanding-why-animation-important-creativefrontiersinc" target="_blank">Why animations are important</a>.
