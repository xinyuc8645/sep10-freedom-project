<h1>My purpose and motivation for choosing this specfic topic.</h1>

Before I answer my purpose of why I decided to choose this topic and my motivates for it, you may be asking me like "You know there are tons of other options for you to choose from right? Ranging from arts, businesses, sports and so much more. Well it's just that those other option doesn't really interest me specfically Alright, now that I'm ready, so why did I choose the topic of animation in the first place? Well it had all to circulate back to like a few years ago, I became really intereste in animated shorts, and films, specfically as you may known it to today, as anime, which is very popular in Japan and outside of Japan. The way the studios would animate an character smoothly, and the way they depcit the plot of the story, really pulls me in into animating. For example, anime's like Demon Slayer and Fate series, are very popular due to their animations being top quality and putted into efforts. Thus why it pulls me in as an blackhole. While I research about articles for animations, I've come acrossed [Why animations are important](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/understanding-why-animation-important-creativefrontiersinc) 
 by Linkedin and [6 reasons why people love animations](https://www.fudgeanimation.com/journal-category/insight) by Fudge. These articles sparkle more interest through for my passive for animations. And of course these article caught my eyes within an instant. Now my backup ideas aren't really that impressive, but it was designs and another one being AI but, dumb me not knowing that AI was only for exlusive tech's. The reason of why I choose design as my backup ideas, since I love the different design between character's model themsevles in animation, and the clothes they wear. It really helps me determined what their personality is, their traits, their culture, and so many more. The idea of desiging makes my mind expand, and makes me creative.
