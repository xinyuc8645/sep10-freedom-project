# Entry 5: More In-depth Tinkering for my tool Aframe Along With Code Snippets
##### 4/11/25

# Context Before Diving in
As you may already know, base on the last blog entry 4,(if you haven't read it yet [read entry 4 here](entry04.md)) I mentioned and talked about tinkering with my tool Aframe and why I choose Aframe as my tool for the whole Freedom Project. But one thing  I didn't do was talk in-depth about the tinkering. I only talk about the basics, to which in this blog 5 I want to really go in deeper with my tinkering, and some codes I tried out and evidences of me coding by providing code snippets and syntax. So let's now deep straight into the tinkering section.
# Tinkering In-depth with Aframe
# Engineering Designing Process
Base on the last blog 4, I said that I was still in-between the creating and the planning section. But I can confidently said that I'm offically moving out of the territory of the planning section into the creating section. Since planning, I associate that with like learning your tool since you need to watch video and make a plan for yourself of how you want to tinker with those tools. The reason why I'm saying I'm at the creating section is because right now, I tinkered with my tools Aframe to the point where I understand most of it's concept (Maybe except for some concept like NRM maps and etc). I think I can fully stand in the creating section if I watch alll the tutorial for Aframe in my playlist over the break. So currently, I am in the creating section of the engineering designing process, but only like 50% of the way of there, so expect the next blog to have fully 100% on the creating section.
