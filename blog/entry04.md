# Context On How I Decided On Aframe
Well, well we are back again times past by face don't you think so? 2 months ago I was still getting ideas and inspiration for tools that can used for my topic of animation and now I finalized on the tool I decide to work with for my topic. Which is Aframes!! Surprising is it? Maybe not? I know for sure lots of my classmates are using Aframe in my class since its the most simplest one and the one that is most glazed(joking) by our teacher after all.. Well anyways just a bit of context before getting into the real content. I won't yap too much this time like entry 3. I don't know where I menetioned this before but our teacher had given us websites and tools that we can use for our topic on freedom project. However before you actually USE it. You must first tinker with it. What I mean is play around with it like testing it first. The list of tools were seperated into 3 categories. It was sepearated into mild, spicy, EXTRA SPICY. The more spicy it is the more harder it is basically. And honestly there were lot's of tools to choose from. But there was something my teacher said that really made me being extra careful. He said that "once you finalized and decide on the tool your using, you CANNOT change your tool mid-way during your project". Honestly this scared me but it give me like an warning because I have to be careful of what I choose and what I work with. And so I looked and looked. But before I actually decided on Aframe, we had to choose 3. And after careful examination. I picked Bulma, Aframe, and Skeleton. The list is from 1st to 3rd. You might be wondering how in the world did you pick Aframe as you finalized choice if you put Bulma first. Well you'll see... Okay so after this was done the next monday we came in we were to tinkered with basically all of the 3 choices we picked. The reason I choose Aframe over both Bulma and skeleton was. One Bulma focuses more on Css related stuff, like coloring, texting resizing which I don't think it'll be useful for my topic of animation since I need to actually create a model of my idea. The same goes with skeleton. Second, I did do some pre-tinkering for Aframe and I loved how you can change the objects size and width and create 3d models right in your IDE which is so simple. Now that you know the context let's move on how I actually tinkered with it.
