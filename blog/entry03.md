# Entry 3:Part B For Freedom Project
##### 12/18/24

# Context 
Earlier on the entry 2, I talked about animations softwares and hardwares device that exists within our time period like Adobe, Drawing Tablet,Zoetrope and etc, which counts as part A. Which mainly focuses on animation that exists right now or is created in the past and still exists today. However, now instead of focusing on part A, we now shifts into part B. Part B mainly focuses on inventions that relate to the topic that we can possibly create for the future, and we have to brainstorm ideas that relate both to our topic and our invention. Below I'll discuss more about part B.
## Part B;Researching and Brainstormming
Now for part B, we were told to post our idea for future invention that relates to our topic to our school communication website called [Slack](https://slack.com/). However, sadly I was absent on monday, which didn't give me a chance to post any ideas. However, I did go through my classmates ideas for future inventions that relate to their topic. But I wasn't just looking for "any" ideas, I was looking for topic ideas that relate to mine topic which was animation. And one of my classmate name Bekhruz did come up with 2 possible future invention that can be used for animation. One of them was EDA(Emotion-Driven Animation) basically, it's so in the future, whenever you create an animation or draw an animation, you can put your emotions and moods into those animation. So that they have different type of mood base on what their reaction is. So that they aren't just some plain moodness looking animation like an robot. The next idea bekhruz metioned HDP(Holo-Directional Projection), its made so that the animation could look 3D holographic alike, so that when people walk around it, they can interact with the animation. Now, all these points that Bekhruz made all really caught my attention because it kind of sparked an idea out of me. I kind of wanted to make an future invention that is related to animation but combined with the 2 ideas that bekhruz metioned. And so I went out on a journey to do my researches.
