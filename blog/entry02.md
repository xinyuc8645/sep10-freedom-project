<h1>Hardwares and Softwares that relates to my topic:Animations</h1>

Software that I found that relates to animation was an website or an app called "Adobe"
Now, now I know you may think "Hey, that's just an normal ordinary app/website! Whats so special that you, yourself have to dive deeper and gain more information and knowledge about the website? Well, to answer that question, I must first tell you all the details about the website first. And What specfically it provides. Firstly when I clicked into this website called [Adobe](https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/animation-software.html) it greets me with an cartoon kid's bears that in the middle stands out saying "Animtion Software from Adobe" My first impression of this was mixed between questionable and rather it was reliable or not, because I thought this was an kid's website for learning, but it isn't actually not. Just to add on to my first impressions, I noticed that this website is very smooth when scrolling and no typos made in any of the sections and writing. It's also very easy to understand this website's function. Like at the top white bar there is a section called "Creativity and Design" which then when you click on it, it brings down lot's of stuffs, like products, shopping for animation related stuff, and lastly plans and trials (which we will dive a little more deeper more further on, so for now let's stay on the surface of the website)
