### Softwares For Animations
Software that I found that relates to animation was an website or an app called "Adobe"
Now, now I know you may think "Hey, that's just an normal ordinary app/website! Whats so special that you, yourself have to dive deeper and gain more information and knowledge about the website? Well, to answer that question, I must first tell you all the details about the website first. And What specfically it provides. Firstly when I clicked into this website called [Adobe](https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/animation-software.html) it greets me with an cartoon kid's bears that in the middle stands out saying "Animtion Software from Adobe" My first impression of this was mixed between questionable and rather it was reliable or not, because I thought this was an kid's website for learning, but it isn't actually not. Just to add on to my first impressions, I noticed that this website is very smooth when scrolling and no typos made in any of the sections and writing. It's also very easy to understand this website's function. Like at the top white bar there is a section called "Creativity and Design" which then when you click on it, it brings down lot's of stuffs, like products, shopping for animation related stuff, and lastly plans and trials (which we will dive a little more deeper more further on, so for now let's stay on the surface of the website)Additionally, the adobe website gives us like an basic overview of how the software is going to work regarding for animations and how is it going to be animated. It is also splitted into each own section. If you scroll a little down you'll see the section where it saids "Make your Animation Move" and there it has 3 sections. I'll be elaborating the 3 sections. The first section including that, we can animate by using real life system, for example like our devics webcam and to trace the outlines. More [details about using webcam to animate](https://www.adobe.com/products/character-animator.html). The second section talks about how to add effects towards your animations, and how you can animate like pros, like those highly animated movies that requires great effort and work hours. More [details about the effect and improving your animation](https://www.adobe.com/products/animate.html). The third section covers about how to add afetereffects within your animations, like adding mind blowing effects, changing the scene's weather, logo's illustration and etc. More [amazing information about changing weather and aftereffects within your awesome prototype animation](https://www.adobe.com/products/aftereffects.html). Moving on, if you clicked on any of those links towards each section, you can see that each section has it's own bundle with its own amount of usuage, with the first section costing $59.99 USD a month, second section costing $22.99 USD a month, and third section also costing $22.99 a month. Even though I'm not sure if you can use this software without paying, the cost of the bundle might be worth it depending on what the usage is. Just to add, it seems that nowhere on this website, has an way to contact the website's owner, but there is an phone number at the very bottom saying "800-585-0774". This could be used for customer support probably. When you scroll towards the middle of the adobe page. You might noitced that there is another 3 section side by side of each other, each with their own label. The main label of the section being "Turn Aspiration into Animation".
There's a video for each of the 3 section provided.[Seeing how character animator](:https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/animation-software.html#discover-card-character-animator )[Animating](https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/animation-software.html#discover-card-after-effects-and-photoshop).(The third link will not be provided because due to unsafe popup when clicked on the link so it might not be safe for the uesr.) Overall, this seems kind of safe and reliable, in my opinion but in order to be access to some of the perks, you have to pay for them, so this website may not be your top choice, if you really want to animate without having to spend a dime at all. One last thing, the color and the layout of the website is very layed out and is able to catch someone's attention really quickly.
### Hardwares For Animations
Some hardwares I've found for my topic "animations" were Zoetrope, and an drawing tablet. First, I've dive deeper into Zoetrope, then into the drawing tablet. Not sure if you've heard the name Zoetrope before, but it's an old method of animating, without having to use modern technologies and any mechanical parts. This was an device people used back in the 1800s and the 1900s to illstruate images, that would look like it's in motion mode. First glance, of this Zoetrope device, it looks like an table but isn't flat, but instead it's circle shape like an coloseeum with lot's of images and illstruation pictured filled inside it. The main purpose of this device was to illusions of motion because metioned before, back then people did not have advanced technologies and equipment to animate stuff in motion. Therefore, people created this device instead. It was first introduced back in the 1800s more specically somewhere around 1833s. It's said that "William George Horner" is one of the inventors of this device. How this device worked was that there are several different stripes of images and you would insert that stripe into the circle. Overall, the zoetrope devices seems very interesting and creative considering, it actually [mimics illusion of motions](https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/animation/discover/zoetrope-animation.html#:~:text=A%20zoetrope%20is%20a%20cylinder,the%20images%20from%20blurring%20together.)
