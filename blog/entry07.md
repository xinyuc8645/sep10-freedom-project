# Entry 7: Result of the FP Website/Presentation and Elevator Pitch During The Expo
##### 5/26/25
# Context
Keeping the context short again: Alright, so this will be like a transition from blog 6 to blog 7, as for this blog, I'll be going over the result of my presentation during class, and explaning the feedbacks I got back from my teacher, and explaining what an elevator pitch is and using that during my presentation during the expo towards other people.

So,
# Content Part 2/Elevator Pitch
# Enigerring Designing Process
Alright, so pretty sure for the last blog, I mentioned that I hope that I'll be on the testing part of the EDP process, however I do not believe this is possible currently at the moment. If you are unaware as for me, SEP10 is coming to an wrap. This <strong><em>DOES NOT MEAN</strong></em> the class itself is ending (like no more), but just means that for the blogs it will be stopped here until the next new school year. So, therefore I think, I'm not ready to test anytime soon. Additionally, I don't have my own future design I have in mind right now, because during the expo when people asked me "what my future invention for animation will be?" I just told them "Currently I don't have one in my mind right now, but all I can think of currently is an type of robotic tool that can help animators reduce the time they need to animate certan frames and scene, by using their own hand because it will tire them out." So I think I need to do a little more research on my future invention for my topic of my animation. So in conclusion I'm going back a couple of steps to planning.

# Skills
### Basic Presentation Skills
When I say basic presentation skills I mean, the ability to make eye contact, speak clearly and presenting your presentation to the audience in a way,they feel entertained. Why might this be considered skills and important? Well, first theses are <strong>CORE</strong> basic presentation/communication skills. If you don't do any of them, there is an less likely chance anyone will be interested in your presentation and feel engaged. Secondly, speaking from my own experience, I myself don't like to make a lot of eye contact, except when I'm with my friends. When you make eye contact with someone, not only does it show respect but it also shows that your being more confident. If you don't make any, you'll just be stuck in an cave forever, and develop social anxiety. Speaking clearly is also an presentation/communcation skill because, if you speak so low, who is going to hear you right? If you speak loud and clear people can hear you and ask you questions towards the end. You might think speaking clearly, and not muttering seems not important, but it actually is because, during presentation in my class, sometimes the AC would go off, and sometimes people with muttered and low voice have to talk over that, which only does it make harder for the audience to listen to any information but also seems like if the presenter isn't talking at all. (Not to call anyone out) And lastly, making the your presentation feel more lively. This is extremely important because, you don't want to go up to infront of the whole class and say "hey this is my presentation" with like an boring tone. But instead make it so its engaging and can hook the audience into your presentation.
### Elevator Pitch
I consider elevator pitch an skill because, not only was this taught to us by our teacher during the expo. But it serves as an way in which to basically sum up your information within an short amount of time, instead of yapping for paragraphs and paragraphs and making the audience bored. Upon, further researching of "why elevator pitch is consider an skill and important" it is stated that, not only does it allow you to introduce your topic, and the information for your topic in an short time, but its also very consisted. Right now it may not seem useful for me, but I believe in the future it will.
