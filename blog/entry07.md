# Entry 7: Result of the FP Website/Presentation and Elevator Pitch During The Expo
##### 5/26/25
# Context
Keeping the context short again: Alright, so this will be like a transition from blog 6 to blog 7, as for this blog, I'll be going over the result of my presentation during class, and explaning the feedbacks I got back from my teacher, and explaining what an elevator pitch is and using that during my presentation during the expo towards other people.

# Content Part 2/Elevator Pitch
# Enigerring Designing Process
Alright, so pretty sure for the last blog, I mentioned that I hope that I'll be on the testing part of the EDP process, however I do not believe this is possible currently at the moment. If you are unaware as for me, SEP10 is coming to an wrap. This <strong><em>DOES NOT MEAN</strong></em> the class itself is ending (like no more), but just means that for the blogs it will be stopped here until the next new school year. So, therefore I think, I'm not ready to test anytime soon. Additionally, I don't have my own future design I have in mind right now, because during the expo when people asked me "what my future invention for animation will be?" I just told them "Currently I don't have one in my mind right now, but all I can think of currently is an type of robotic tool that can help animators reduce the time they need to animate certan frames and scene, by using their own hand because it will tire them out." So I think I need to do a little more research on my future invention for my topic of my animation. So in conclusion I'm going back a couple of steps to planning.
