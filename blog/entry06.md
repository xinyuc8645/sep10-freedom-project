# Entry 6:MVP Of My Freedom Project Website (Not Beyond MVP)
##### 5/5/25
# Context As Usual
Base on the last entry; 5 in that entry I included how I tinker with my Aframe tool. As for this blog, I want to dive in on how I created my website for Freedom Project for MVP(Mininum Viable Product). And yea that's basically all for the context. Just do note that this entry may get a little bit of lengthy depending on how much information I put, but I do want to keep this entry short as possible.So, I guess sit back and relax?..
#Part 1
# Engieering Design Process
As for this entry, I wanna still say that I'm more leaning towards the creating type. The reason is because, if you don't know the whole reason that we're even doing a website for Freedom Project is for the FP fair thats upcoming. And since I create an website, that is MVP I think its pretty decent. I wouldn't say its super good, because there are still bugs, organization stuff I have to fix and etc. But I defeintely want to shift towards away from the planning side. And lean towards more of creating. And hopefully by next entry I'll be on testing for my <em>Beyond MVP</em> website.
