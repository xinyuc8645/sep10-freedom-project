  <h1>What Is Animation? And Who Discovered It?</h1>
  <p>
    What exactly is animation? Animation is where you are able to make a block still image turn into an image that can move with various moves. For example, let’s say there’s a picture of a person standing near the door. But we want to make that person do some kind of movement and wave goodbye to someone. Thus, this is where animation comes in clutch and can help you make those movements come in real.
  </p>
  <p>
    Animations were first discovered in the 19th century, more specifically in 1907 in France by an artist named “Emile Cohl.” He discovered animation during his career in the industry of filmmaking using the advantage of stop motion techniques. Throughout the years, many inventions have been made in order prior to animation, but how does modern technology come in usage in animation?
  </p>
  <p>
    Well, modern technologies help to create the animations of certain characters and their motions more life-like, the environments realistic like the winds blowing, and having certain action sequences to the characters. Both modern and old animation technologies will be discussed below.

        The website URL does not seem to end with typical extensions like .com, .edu, .gov, but instead ends with .html, so its reliability is uncertain.
        Upon visiting the site, it appears very clean and easy to navigate, offering a family-friendly experience with no inappropriate content.
        The site provides a basic overview of the software, explaining how it can be animated. The site is divided into sections, with the first explaining how you can animate in real-time using your device's webcam. Essentially, it's a website telling you about the software that hosts another site. At the bottom of the page, there’s a payment bundle labeled “Creative Cloud All Apps.”

         Third section: $22.99 USD/month<br>

        There is no contact information on the website except for a phone number for purchasing the bundle: “800-585-0774.”<br>
        Near the bottom of the page, there’s a section labeled “Turn inspiration into animation,” where you can watch three videos showing how characters are animated, how it works, and how After Effects and Photoshop are integrated.<br>
        Links to each section:<br>

        The site is very smooth, and it's accessible across all devices. Users only need to scroll to navigate. Overall, the website seems safe and reliable. However, some features and perks require payment to access.

  <!-- 3 paragraphs side-by-side -->
  <div class="col-lg-4">
    <p>First glance it’s like a table but instead of being flat it’s like a circle like a colosseum filled with different pictures frame by frame.
      It produces the illusion of motion, since back then the people didn’t have advanced technology and devices to make animation moveable.
      It was first introduced in the early 1800s specifically in 1833. It is said that “William George Horner” is one of the inventors of this device.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="col-lg-4">
    <p>How it works is that there are different strips with different pictures/drawings and you would insert that inside that circle.
      It is also described as it’s following:”When the cylinder spins, the user can see the pictures inside as they look through the slits, which prevent the images from blurring together.”</p>
  </div>

  <div class="col-lg-4">
    <p>First glance, it looks like an ordinary tablet to be honest. However it comes with a pen that is used to interact with the tablet instead of using your hands. It comes in different shapes and sizes but mostly it’s very huge.
      It can also be connected to your computer. Making it very easy to follow what you want to draw and animate with.
      How drawing tablet work is that you have a pen and there is like an empty pad for you to draw on, and then whatever movement your pen does, it will trace it over to the screen (some comes with separate like an ipad then an tablet making it 2 devices)
      Often these devices cost a lot of money, however it seems the higher the price, the higher quality the devices provide for you when it comes to drawing and animating.</p>
