            <p>(What is Animation?)
              What exactly is animation?  Animation is where you are able to make a block still image,  turn into an image that can move with various moves.
              (Example of Animation )
               For example let’s say there’s a picture of a person standing near the door. But we want to make that person do some kind of movement and wave goodbye to someone. Thus this is where animation comes in clutch and can help you make those movements come in real.
                (Who Invented Animation/How was it discovered?)
              Animations were first discovered in the 19th century more specifically in 1907 in France by an artist named “Emile Cohl”. He discovered animation during his career in the industry of filmmaking using the advantage of stop motion techniques.
              (Concluding sentence)
              Throughout the years many inventions have been made in order prior to animation, but how does modern technology come in usage in animation? Well modern technologies help to create the animations of certain characters and their motions more life-like, the environments realistic like the winds blowing, and having certain action sequences to the characters.
              (Transitioning sentence)
              Both modern and old animation technologies will be discussed below.

        <p>The website URL does not seem to end with anything like .com, .edu , .gov , but instead it ends with .html so I don’t really know if that’s reliable.
          When clicked into the website, the website looked really clean, easy to understand, looked family friendly, nothing inappropriate.
          The website gives us a basic overview of what the software is going to be about, how it is going to be animated. Also splitted into different sections
          Different sections like: First part saying that we can animate using real time, by using your devices webcam. Meaning a new part of the website. Basically a website, telling you about the software that contains another website.
