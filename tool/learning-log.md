  <ul>
  <li>Finalized on the tool Aframe</li>
  <li>Installed/Put in the code that is require in order for Aframe to work for my IDE through the <a href= "https://aframe.io/docs/1.7.0/introduction/"> Aframe Website</a></li>
  <li>Have a little bit of time lefted in class,started watching through the playlist of Aframe Tutorial's ranging from least complex-->most complex.
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktjMCanKNLk&list=PL8MkBHej75fJD-HveDzm4xKrciC5VfYuV">The playlist of the aframe tutorials</a></li>
  You can create any shape by using the:
  
     <a-(shape)> , </a-(shape)>. Like, <a-box>, </a-box> and <a-cylinder>,</a-cylinder> 
  <li> Was very fun see to see different shapes and the fact you can see the whole thing of the shape since by doing http-server it gives you 360 view meaning you can rotate it however you want.</li>
  <li> Changed colors of the shape, changed box color from white-->blue. Also changed the width and the height to both 5 and 3.</li>
  <li>Final result of the blue box looks weird but I guess progress is progress</li>
  <li> Final conclusion 2/41 tutorial of Aframe watched. </li>
  <li>Next learning log hoping to cover 2 videos for Aframe tutorial</li>
</ul>
