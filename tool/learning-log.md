# Tool Learning Log

## Tool: Aframe

---

## 2/24/25+3/3/25:First Tool learning log

  <ul>
  <li>Finalized on the tool Aframe</li>
  <li>Installed/Put in the code that is require in order for Aframe to work for my IDE through the <a href= "https://aframe.io/docs/1.7.0/introduction/"> Aframe Website</a></li>
  <li>Have a little bit of time lefted in class,started watching through the playlist of Aframe Tutorial's ranging from least complex-->most complex.
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktjMCanKNLk&list=PL8MkBHej75fJD-HveDzm4xKrciC5VfYuV">The playlist of the aframe tutorials</a></li>
  You can create any shape by using the:
  
     <a-(shape)> , </a-(shape)>. Like, <a-box>, </a-box> and <a-cylinder>,</a-cylinder> 
  <li> Was very fun see to see different shapes and the fact you can see the whole thing of the shape since by doing http-server it gives you 360 view meaning you can rotate it however you want.</li>
  <li> Changed colors of the shape, changed box color from white-->blue. Also changed the width and the height to both 5 and 3.</li>
  <li>Final result of the blue box looks weird but I guess progress is progress</li>
  <li> Final conclusion 2/41 tutorial of Aframe watched. </li>
  <li>Next learning log hoping to cover 2 videos for Aframe tutorial</li>
</ul>

### 3/11/25: Second Learning Log
<ul>
  <li>Starting from the video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liOLtcPmMa0&list=PL8MkBHej75fJD-HveDzm4xKrciC5VfYuV&index=4"> Position And Relative Positioning</a></li>
<li>There is the positioning where there's 3 values.</li>
<li>One is the x value, one is the y value and the last one is the z value</li>
<li> Also something I learned from the video is that Aframe apparently uses the "right hand coordinate system"</li>
<li> And this system focuses kind of on the camera angle. The x being like the thumb and the y being the pointy finger, and the z being the third finger.
I won't get that much in detail but if you would like to know more watch the video.</li>
<li> Some examples I did were:</li>


             <a-box color= "skyblue"                                 
            height="3"
            position="0 10 0"
            width="2"
            length="1.5">

          </a-box>
          <a-cone color="red">

          </a-cone>
          and 
           <a-box color= "skyblue"
            height="3"
            position="20 0 0"
            width="2"
            length="1.5">

          </a-box>
          <a-cone color="red">

          </a-cone>
<li>As for the example above, you seen that I changed the y position first, and when I tested it it made the box I made go up.</li>
<li>I put a cone because I wanted to see what direction would the box</li>
<li>If changed y it seems to go --> up, and when I changed x position it seems to go --> infront, however for the z value I did test it but I couldn't really figure out which way since when I set it to 10, it just go the same direction as x </li>
<li>For the final product for positioning regularly I just made:</li>


       <a-box color= "skyblue"
            height="3"
            position="10 2 -5"
            width="2"
            length="8"
            depth="0.3">
          </a-box>

          </a-box>
          <a-cone color="red">
<li>Which from my POV, I reload the page and when I try to find my box it was to the left side of the cone</li>
<li>This is the final result I did for this video:</li>


         <a-box color= "skyblue"
            height="3"
            position="10 2 -5"
            width="5.5"
            length="20"
            depth="0.2">
            <a-circle position="1 0 0.111"
                      color="orange"
                      side="double">
                    </a-circle>
                    </a-circle>
            </a-circle>
          </a-box>


          </a-box>
<li>Just to clearlifed that there is a circle right underneath and inside the box is so that this positioning and the css for the circle is connected to the box. Because the final result of this should be the orange circle sticking right onto the green box.</li>
<li>Also if you're curious there is a "double" code I put, the double code allows it so that the shape can be viewed at both side, so basically if you can see it at the right side, you can also see it on the left side</li>
<li>Ending off, I say this is some good progress but this video did have lot's of information since it was 9 minutes long</li>
<li>Next learning log hoping, to finish at least 2 and a half video, since the next one is 4 minute but the one after that is 20 minutes long</li>
<li>No questions I have nor do am I struggling on anything</li>
